    <h1>Anand Srinivasan</h1>

    <p>
      I'm an avid researcher passionate about implementing scalable AI/ML solutions that make a real-world impact. 
      My main focus has been on anomaly detection — a domain where subtle patterns and data deviations can signal 
      critical insights in fields like cybersecurity, finance, and systems monitoring.
      Why Anomaly Detection and not other "hot" fields like NLP and Generative AI? 
      Well I'm personally of the opinion that saving resources is as important as gaining them. 
      And disastrous events that could end up being costly to the unprepared entity? Completely preventable!
      Ranging from projects in Malware analysis with GNNs and OCSVM embeddings to protect devices against zero-day attacks, 
      to privacy-preserving federated learning models for attestation of IoT devices — I have discovered different aspects of security 
      and their importance.
      On the way, I also developed a novel cryptographic algorithm using geometry-based approaches for resource-constrained IoT devices, 
      which is currently under patent review and has potential use cases in spatial cryptography.

      What fuels my curiosity is not just the algorithms themselves, but how they intersect with human behavior and decision-making. 
      That is, after all, why we're here — to use ML methods as a tool to quickly understand patterns that we simply do not have the capability 
      to compute on our own. This is why I believe in building systems that are not just accurate, but interpretable too.
      My interactions with my professors at BITS Hyderabad have also made me aware of the dangerous potential AI could have in the wrong hands. 
      I am here to build ethical failsafes against such scenarios!
      I am currently involved in multiple projects, including recursive clustering-based causality, hybrid anomaly detection frameworks, 
      and a neural distortion–based interpretable anomaly detection framework.
      Looking forward to updating all of it on my Git soon!
    </p>

    <p>
      On the fun side, I enjoy penning down my thoughts, singing, playing outdoor sports like basketball and football, and long-distance running. 
      I am also an athlete and have competed in international Wushu competitions, even bagging silver at the Malaysia International Wushu Championship in 2018.
      Outside of research, I love to travel and engage with diverse communities — every trip offers new perspectives that influence how I think 
      about AI’s role in society.
      I'm only just 21, and there is always more to discover. I travel to conferences as much as I can — sometimes as a presenter, sometimes as a student 
      hunting for improvements in their next big projects. Every place I visit is an opportunity: a chance to network, review, and rethink with purpose.
      I believe the places you go change you — and the amount you travel and learn determines your net positive change. 
      But change you must.
