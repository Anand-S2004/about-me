    <h1>Anand Srinivasan</h1>
    <p>
      I’m an avid researcher who is really passionate about building scalable AI/ML systems that deliver meaningful real-world impact. 
      My work has an emphasis on anomaly detection, a field that has applications in practically everything that deals with data
      like cybersecurity, finance, and large-scale system monitoring. 

    </p>
    <p>
      I chose anomaly detection over more popular areas like NLP or generative AI because I believe that preventing losses is as
      important as generating new value. Many disastrous and costly events are entirely avoidable with the right predictive safeguards 
      as most of them are predictable outliers for a given dataset. Through projects ranging from malware analysis using GNNs with
      OCSVM embeddings to privacy-preserving federated learning models for IoT attestation, I’ve explored several dimensions of 
      security and their practical importance. Along the way, I developed a novel geometry-based cryptographic algorithm for 
      resource-constrained IoT devices, currently under patent review with potential applications in spatial cryptography.

      </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      
      What drives me is not only the algorithms, but also their interaction with human behavior and decision-making.
      Machine learning helps us understand patterns far beyond anything we as humans can compute on our own, and this fuels my
      interest in AI systems for big data analysis. My interactions with my professors and batchmates at BITS-Hyderabad have shown
      me how powerful and potentially dangerous ML systems can be without the proper safeguards. This has thus driven my own 
      commitment to designing ethical and transparent AI frameworks with an emphasis on explainability.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m currently involved in projects on recursive clustering–based causality, hybrid anomaly detection architectures,
      and a neural distortion–based interpretable anomaly detection framework. I look forward to sharing these on my GitHub soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside research, I enjoy writing, singing, basketball, football, and long-distance running. I’m also an athlete and I have competed
      internationally in Wushu, winning silver at the Malaysia International Wushu Championship (2018). I love traveling, meeting people,
      creating networking opportunities from them. I also gravitate towards conferences— sometimes as a presenter, sometimes as a 
      student looking for a direction to start a new project in. Each place I visit offers a chance to learn, reflect, and refine my 
      thoughts on technology and society.
      At 21, I feel like I’m just getting started. There is always more to explore, and I’m excited for all the opportunities and challenges I face ahead.
